# Introduction


The SCCM solution template provides detailed information of your System Center Configuration Manager including client and server health, malware protection, software updates, and software inventory across your organization.

The template lets you do things like:

-   Compare key System Center Configuration Manager metrics to personalized targets and see how they trend over time

-   Identify trouble spots and get the information you need to understand what needs to be done

The following document provides a walkthrough of installation steps as well as information on cost. For any questions not covered in this document, please contact the team at <PBISolnTemplates@microsoft.com>

# Architecture 

![Architecture](Resources/Images/Arch.png)

The flow of the SCCM solution template is as follows:

-   Windows task scheduler launches a process that pulls data from your SCCM database each day.

-   The task copies data into Azure SQL (or SQL server)

-   Power BI imports data from Azure SQL (or SQL server) and renders pre-defined reports

# System Requirements

-   System Center 2012 Configuration Manager R2 SP1 (5.00.8239.1000) or later. Read access to System Center Configuration Manager database is required.

-   Destination database: Azure SQL database or SQL Server database (SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or later).

-   For the machine where the installation is run,

    -   Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or later.

    -   PowerShell version 3.0 or later.

    -   For Operating System: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, or later. Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or later. Note that Windows 10 anniversary update (1607 or later) is not supported at this moment because of a bug in credential guard.

# How to Install


![Image2](Resources/Images/GetStarted.png)

**Step 1: Connect to SCCM database**

Enter a server name for your SCCM database, provide a credential to the server, validate a connection to the server, and choose your SCCM database. Note that the template supports System Center 2012 Configuration Manager R2 SP1 (5.00.8239.1000) or later. The credential used to connect to SCCM will be used to create a scheduled task to pull data from SCCM.

![Image3](Resources/Images/ConnectSCCM.png)

**Step 2: Connect to your destination database**

Enter a server name for your destination database, validate a connection to the server, and choose your database.

-   Option 1 (Azure SQL): SQL user name and password is required.

-   Option 2 (SQL server): either Windows authentication or SQL authentication.

Note that database owner role is required to create tables and execute stored procedures.

![Image4](Resources/Images/ConnectSQL.png)

**Step 3: Customize your settings**

Configure the following parameters and click “Validate”.

-   Daily Trigger Time: specify the condition that will trigger the daily task. (at 2:00 AM by default)

-   Data Retention Days: between 1 and 365

-   Endpoint Compliance Target: between 0 and 1

-   Health Evaluation Target: between 0 and 1

Note that the scheduled task will not be triggered if a machine goes to sleep. The task will be restarted as soon as possible when the machine is out of sleep mode.

![Image5](Resources/Images/Config.png)

**Step 4: Verify and run**

Verify the information and click “Run”.

![Image6](Resources/Images/Verify.png)

**Step 5: Track your progress**

The setup will create new tables, views, stored procedures in destination database, install required SQL tools if not found, create/run a new task.

![Image7](Resources/Images/Track.png)

**Step 6: Start pulling data**

We'll show you progress while you wait. Please don't close the browser until all the steps are completed. This might take a while, depending on the size of your SCCM database.

![Image8](Resources/Images/Track2.png)

**Step 7: Download PBIX**

Download your Power BI report, open the report, and click “Apply changes” as below. Note that Power BI Desktop is required to open the report (Power BI Desktop can be download from [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)).

![Image9](Resources/Images/image9.png)

Please click “Refresh” to import data from your destination database and enter your credentials.

![Image10](Resources/Images/image10.png)

**Step 8: Publish the report to PowerBI.com**

At this point, you should be able to see your SCCM data. If you are interested in publishing the report to [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) and share it with colleagues, click “Publish” to Power BI.

# Reports walkthrough

### Overview:

The report provides a high level overview of key SCCM metrics to quickly identify machines not up-to-date with software updates, failed mitigations to malware infections to be able to act promptly, failed updates and more.

![Image12](Resources/Images/image12.png)

### Protection:

You can track key protection measures for the period you configured during the installation.

![Image13](Resources/Images/image13.png)

### Malware:

The report shows trend of resolved/unresolved malware count by severity, OS, and remediation type. Malware Category chart (lower-left) shows numbers of resolved malware (color saturation by unresolved malware).

![Image14](Resources/Images/image14.png)

Note that you can enable drill down by selecting the arrow icon in the top right corner of the bar chart. To drill down one field at a time, double-click one of the chart bars. For drill down in details, please click [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-service-drill-down-in-a-visualization/).

![Image15](Resources/Images/image15.png)

### Update Compliance:

The report lists missing updates by severity and device that can be used to take action.

![Image16](Resources/Images/image16.png)

We provide hyperlinks for the missing updates in the table (lower-left). You can click the urls for more information.

# Technical Description
This section describes each component of the solution template in detail.

## Client Data Extraction and Load

A powershell script dataload.ps1 found in the folder C:\ProgramData\Business Platform Solution Templates\Microsoft-SCCMTemplate 
executes a collection of scripts to pull data from the source SCCM datatbase into a flat file, bcp it to the
destination database, and executes stored procedures in the destination database to merge this data with the results from 
prior loads.

The script is executed from Task Scheduler. To change or pause the schedule, open Task Scheduler and locate the Task "Power BI Solution Template - SCCM". 

The same data is pulled with each load. Destination database stored procedures merge the results.

## Understanding Credentials for Accessing the SCCM and Target Databases

The task requires credentials to be able to access the SCCM and for the target databases. These credentials are securely stored with
Credential Manager.

You can manually manage the credentials for both the SCCM and target database after the solution template
is provisioned. To change the windows credentials used to access the SCCM DB and target database, open task
scheduler, find the task "Power BI Solution Template - SCCM" and change the task's credentials.

To change the credentials used to access the target database when SQL Authentication was used, open Credential Manager (open Control Panel and search for Credential Manager), and edit the credential "pbi_sccm".

## SQL Server DB - SQL Server or Azure SQL Database 
### Tables

The following additional tables are created in to the target database.

<sub>

### Views

For the most part, all views are simple selects from the tables.

Exception to this is [pbist_sccm].[vw_computer] where an extra column [operating system name] is
 added as a friendly name for operating system.

### Stored Procedures

Each table in the template populated with data from SCCM has a corresponding stored procedure 
executed from the powershell that merges the most recent results. Each stored procedure has the name 
pbist_sccm.sp_populate<TableName>, eg; pbist_sccm.sp_populateSite.

With some exceptions noted below, the general approach for each stored procedure is:

- start a transaction
- truncate the target table
- copy the resuls from the staging table into the target table
- truncate the staging table
- commit the transaction

Exceptions to this approach:
- __pbist_sccmPopulateComputer__: Deleted computers are retained and marked as deleted by setting the deleted
flag. This stored procedure first  sets this flag to the current day if the computer was deleted by SCCM.
A merge statement updates the existing computers with changes and inserts new records.
- __pbist_sccmPopulateScanHistory__: Daily records are maintained. If the stored procedure is run more frequently
than daily, that day's record is updated. A merge statement inserts new records per day or updates that day's records.
- __sp_populatecomputerprogram__: due to the large size of this table, the destination table is simply dropped,  the staging table
is renamed as the destination table, and a new staging table is created.

# Customizing the Template
## Configuration Table

Once you set up the solution template you may want to modify your settings. In order to do this,
 you will the solution template configuration table. It should look something like this:

![Image19](Resources/Images/image19.png)

If you want to change, for example, the data retention days from 120 days to 60 days, the SQL query will be following:

<sub>

```<language>
UPDATE [pbist_sccm].[configuration]
	SET value=60
	WHERE name='dataretentiondays'
```

</sub>

## Extending the Solution Template

__Note: this is an advanced topic and only of interest to developers extending the solution template.__

To add columns to existing tables, take the following steps:
- Change the sql query in the solution template folder C:\ProgramData\Business Platform Solution Templates\Microsoft-SCCMTemplate
- Add the column to the staging and target tables in the destination database
- Update the view in the destination database
- Update the PBIX file

To add a new table to the solution template:
- Add the sql query to retrieve the data from the SCCM database to the template folder, foo.sql
- Add the staging and destination tables to the destination database: pbist_sccm.foo_staging and pbist_sccm.foo
- Add a view to the destination database, pbist_sccm.vw_foo (solution templates alway use a view abstraction from the table so later changes to the underlying table do not necessarily require changes downstream) 
- Update the powershell hashtable file2table in dataload.ps1 in the template folder:

```<language>
$file2table = [ordered]@{ "site.sql"                = "pbist_sccm.site_staging";
                          ...
                          "foo.sql"                 = pbist_sccm.foo_staging";
                          ...
                         };
```




## Cost

Estimated Azure SQL database sizes with number of devices managed by SCCM are following:

| Number of clients | Est. database size (MB) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 500               | 260                     |
| 5,000             | 470                     |
| 50,000            | 2,500                   |
| 500,000           | 23,000                  |

\* data retention is set at 180 days
